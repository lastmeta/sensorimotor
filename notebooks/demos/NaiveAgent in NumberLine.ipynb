    "# Naive Agent in the NumberLine Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the simplest agent exploring the Numberline environment. The Naive agent moves randomly and memorizes where it has been in a tree. The NumberLine environment has 5 available actions corresponding to +0 +1 -1 +10 and -9, with these five actions the na√Øve agent traverses the natural numbers. Once it has explored at random for 1000 actions you can ask it to move anywhere on the number line it has seen before: moving on the number line is exactly the same thing as manipulating the environment since in this environment the only thing the agent can manipulate is it's position in the environment. Still, no matter the complexity of the environment the agent can be thought of as merely traversing its state-space just as it traverses the natural numbers in this simple environment."
