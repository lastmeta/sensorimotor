'''
Predicting the next state is typically a task associated with sequence data, which might be handled using recurrent layers such as LSTM or GRU in Keras. However, if we stick to the simplistic scenario and assume the next state can be predicted from the current state using a dense layer, the architecture would look somewhat similar to the autoencoder, with the exception that the target data during training would be the next state rather than the current state.

Here's how you might adjust the previous example for this task:

In this code:

1. The input layer, encoder layer, and model instantiation remain the same.
2. The decoder layer is renamed to `predicted_next_state`, and its activation function is changed to `'linear'`, which is often more suitable for regression tasks.
3. The model is compiled using the `mean_squared_error` loss function, which is a common choice for regression tasks.
4. Training data (`x_train`) and target data (`y_train`) are provided to the `fit` method, where `y_train` represents the next state you want to predict.

This way, you've altered the autoencoder architecture to predict the next state instead of reconstructing the current state, with a different loss function to measure the prediction error.
