'''
The Simple Agent is a fully AI agent, but the simplest implmentation possible.

It aims at serving as a testing ground for the evolution and development of the
SUGI (the Smallest Unit of General Intelligence) since, being fully AI based, it
must be made up a series of units that can scale horizontally and vertically, 
arranged in a hierarchy of the same sort.

There maybe a simpler AI implmenetation yet, so perhaps this should be called 
the SUGI Agent.
