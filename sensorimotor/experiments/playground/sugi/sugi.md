# Smallest Unit of General Intelligence (SUGI)

sugi is a big idea and one that I think the development of the sensorimotor inference engine could be used to explore. its a maleable memory circuit of some kind that forms hierarchy and maps hyper graphs.

I think the best way is to make an inefficient, clunky minimally viable version of this, then evolve it to improve and optimize it.
